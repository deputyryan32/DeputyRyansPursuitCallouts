# DeputyRyansPursuitCallouts

DeputyRyansPursuitCallouts is an exciting new plugin for LSPDFR, introducing five unique pursuit-based callouts to enhance your GTA V law enforcement experience. These callouts add variety and realism to your patrols, offering challenging situations that will test your skills.

## Callouts Included:
1. **PursuitInProgress**  
   Respond to an ongoing high-speed pursuit already in progress. Backup is needed to assist in apprehending the fleeing suspect.

2. **LargeVehiclePursuit**  
   A large vehicle, such as a truck or bus, is involved in a pursuit. Handle with caution, as these vehicles can cause massive destruction if not stopped.

3. **DrunkDriverPursuit**  
   A suspect driving under the influence has refused to stop and is now fleeing police. Navigate through traffic and prevent a potential disaster.

4. **ArmedRobberyGetaway**  
   After an armed robbery, suspects are fleeing the scene in a getaway vehicle. Engage in a high-stakes pursuit to bring them to justice.

5. **StolenVehiclePursuit**  
   A vehicle reported stolen has been spotted, and the driver is now leading police on a dangerous chase. Be prepared for evasive maneuvers and a tough takedown.
